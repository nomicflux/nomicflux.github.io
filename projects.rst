Ongoing Projects:

    1) `Guitar Chord Trainer <https://github.com/nomicflux/GuitarChordTrainer>`_ - Find chords and scales on a stringed instrument of various tunings.  "Search" by notes used, color notes by interval, and find scales to match chord tones and vice-versa.
    2) `Algorithm Visualizations <https://github.com/nomicflux/okasaki-visualization>`_ - Visualization of the data structures from Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures, as well as other functional structures.
    3) `P-adic Visualization <https://github.com/nomicflux/PadicVisualization>`_ - Visualizations of the P-adic numbers and how they transform based on linear transformations.
    4) `ShantyBot <https://github.com/nomicflux/shantybot>`_ - Twitter Bot which does document lookup and retrieval to find lyrics to sea shanties, based on a Twitter mention of a phrase.
    5) `Servant and Opaleye Tutorial <https://github.com/nomicflux/servant-opaleye-blog>`_ - Setting up a blog with the Haskell web framework Servant and the database library Opaleye.
    6) `Hexation <https://github.com/nomicflux/hexation>`_ - Three-player game based on `Domineering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domineering>`_, with AIs as players. They've been trapped in a cage since birth, learning the game through playing each other - watch how these recluses think and picture the board.
    7) `Hermes Word Predictor <https://github.com/nomicflux/hermes>`_ - A word predictor written as a Shiny app.
    8) `Threals <https://github.com/nomicflux/threals>`_ - Threals, a three-player variant on `Surreal Numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number>`_ and `Combinatorial Game Theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory>`_.  I've been working on their theory, though the main holdup is that I cannot seem to find a zero game, so the theory cannot be made into a group.
    9) `Flux Education <https://github.com/nomicflux/flux-education>`_ - Based on the principle that math should be a) visualizable, b) interactive, and c) able to be explained in English.  (Currently under reconstruction.)
