Ongoing Projects:

     1) `Dialect Coach <https://github.com/nomicflux/dialect-coach>`_ - Chat with AI agents to practice various languages by focusing on local dialects.
     2) `Sarf <https://github.com/nomicflux/sarf>`_ - Browser extension to show morphological information for Arabic words.
     3) `Entangled Graphs <https://github.com/nomicflux/entangled-graphs>`_ - Visualizations of Quantum circuits.
     4) `Danger Mouse <https://github.com/nomicflux/danger-mouse>`_ - A Clojure library for clean handling of errors. Specialized for use in Transducer pipelines.
     5) `SCRPG Helper <https://github.com/nomicflux/scrpg-helper>`_  - Helper application for the Sentinal Comics TTRPG, featuring dice statistics, combat tracking, and character creation.
     6) `Atomic Reason MCP <https://github.com/nomicflux/relevance-logic-mcp>`_ - MCP server to help AI agents clearly articulate their latent assumptions and provide evidence for them.
     7) `Algorithm Visualizations <https://github.com/nomicflux/okasaki-visualization>`_ - Visualization of the data structures from Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures, as well as other functional structures.
     8) `Servant and Opaleye Tutorial <https://github.com/nomicflux/servant-opaleye-blog>`_ - Setting up a blog with the Haskell web framework Servant and the database library Opaleye.
     9) `Hexation <https://github.com/nomicflux/hexation>`_ - Three-player game based on `Domineering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domineering>`_, with AIs as players. They've been trapped in a cage since birth, learning the game through playing each other - watch how these recluses think and picture the board.
    10) `Threals <https://github.com/nomicflux/threals>`_ - Threals, a three-player variant on `Surreal Numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number>`_ and `Combinatorial Game Theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory>`_.  I've been working on their theory, though the main holdup is that I cannot seem to find a zero game, so the theory cannot be made into a group.
    11) `Guitar Chord Trainer <https://github.com/nomicflux/GuitarChordTrainer>`_ - Guitar chord finder, with working version `here <https://nomicflux.github.io/GuitarChordTrainer>`_.
