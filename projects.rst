Ongoing Projects:

    1) `Danger Mouse <https://github.com/nomicflux/danger-mouse>`_ - A Clojure library for clean handling of errors. Specialized for use in Transducer pipelines.
    2) `Atomic Reason MCP <https://github.com/nomicflux/relevance-logic-mcp>`_ - MCP server to help AI agents clearly articulate their latent assumptions and provide evidence for them.
    3) `SCRPG Helper <https://github.com/nomicflux/scrpg-helper>`_  - Helper application for the Sentinal Comics TTRPG, featuring dice statistics, combat tracking, and character creation.
    4) `Algorithm Visualizations <https://github.com/nomicflux/okasaki-visualization>`_ - Visualization of the data structures from Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures, as well as other functional structures.
    5) `Servant and Opaleye Tutorial <https://github.com/nomicflux/servant-opaleye-blog>`_ - Setting up a blog with the Haskell web framework Servant and the database library Opaleye.
    6) `Hexation <https://github.com/nomicflux/hexation>`_ - Three-player game based on `Domineering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domineering>`_, with AIs as players. They've been trapped in a cage since birth, learning the game through playing each other - watch how these recluses think and picture the board.
    7) `Hermes Word Predictor <https://github.com/nomicflux/hermes>`_ - A word predictor written as a Shiny app.
    8) `Threals <https://github.com/nomicflux/threals>`_ - Threals, a three-player variant on `Surreal Numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number>`_ and `Combinatorial Game Theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory>`_.  I've been working on their theory, though the main holdup is that I cannot seem to find a zero game, so the theory cannot be made into a group.
    9) `Guitar Chord Trainer <https://github.com/nomicflux/GuitarChordTrainer>`_ - Guitar chord finder, with working version `here <https://nomicflux.github.io/GuitarChordTrainer>`_.
