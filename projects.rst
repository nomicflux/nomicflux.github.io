Ongoing Projects:

    1) `Flux Education <https://github.com/nomicflux/flux-education>`_ - Based on the principle that math should be a) visualizable, b) interactive, and c) able to be explained in English.
    2) `Algorithm Visualizations
       <https://github.com/nomicflux/okasaki-visualization>`_ - Visualization of
       the data structures from Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures, as
       well as other functional structures.
    3) `Hexation <https://github.com/nomicflux/hexation>`_ - Three-player game based on `Domineering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domineering>`_, with AIs as players. They've been trapped in a cage since birth, learning the game through playing each other - watch how these recluses think and picture the board.
    4) `Threals <https://github.com/nomicflux/threals>`_ - Threals, a three-player variant on `Surreal Numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number>`_ and `Combinatorial Game Theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory>`_.  I've been working on their theory, though the main holdup is that I cannot seem to find a zero game, so the theory cannot be made into a group.
    5) `Servant and Opaleye Tutorial <https://github.com/nomicflux/servant-opaleye-blog>`_ - Setting up a blog with the Haskell web framework Servant and the database library Opaleye.
