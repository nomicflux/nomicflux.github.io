title: About
---
Programmer by day, professional nap artist by night.  My name is Michael Anderson,
and this is my spot to jot down the half-baked thoughts that I got.  My interests
are in functional programming, logic, dependent types, machine learning, and data
analysis.  In off hours, I can be found playing mandolin, studying the martial art
Ninpo, idling through classical philosophy, or sipping a beer here in Milwaukee.

Ongoing Projects:

    1) `Flux Education <https://github.com/nomicflux/flux-education>`_ - Based on the principle that math should be a) visualizable, b) interactive, and c) able to be explained in English.
    2) `Hexation <https://github.com/nomicflux/hexation>`_ - Three-player game based on `Domineering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domineering>`_, with AIs as players. They've been trapped in a cage since birth, learning the game through playing each other - watch how these recluses think and picture the board.
    3) `Threals <https://github.com/nomicflux/threals>`_ - Threals, a three-player variant on Surreal Numbers.  I've been working on their theory, though the main holdup is that I cannot seem to find a zero game, so the theory cannot be made into a group.
    4) `Servant and Opaleye Tutorial <https://github.com/nomicflux/servant-opaleye-blog>`_ - Setting up a blog with the Haskell web framework Servant and the database library Opaleye.
