title: About
---
Programmer by day, professional nap artist by night.  My name is Michael Anderson,
and this is my spot to jot down the half-baked thoughts that I got.  My interests
are in functional programming, logic, dependent types, machine learning, and data
analysis.  In off hours, I can be found playing mandolin, studying the martial art
Ninpo, idling through classical philosophy, or sipping a beer here in Milwaukee.
