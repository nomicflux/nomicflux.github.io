            <p>Programmer by day, professional nap artist by night. My name is Michael Anderson, and this is my spot to jot down the half-baked thoughts that I got. My interests are in functional programming, logic, dependent types, machine learning, and data analysis. In off hours, I can be found playing mandolin, studying the martial art Ninpo, idling through classical philosophy, or sipping a beer here in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Ongoing Projects:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomicflux/flux-education">Flux Education</a> - Based on the principle that math should be a) visualizable, b) interactive, and c) able to be explained in English.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomicflux/hexation">Hexation</a> - Three-player game based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domineering">Domineering</a>, with AIs as players. They’ve been trapped in a cage since birth, learning the game through playing each other - watch how these recluses think and picture the board.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomicflux/threals">Threals</a> - Threals, a three-player variant on Surreal Numbers. I’ve been working on their theory, though the main holdup is that I cannot seem to find a zero game, so the theory cannot be made into a group.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nomicflux/servant-opaleye-blog">Servant and Opaleye Tutorial</a> - Setting up a blog with the Haskell web framework Servant and the database library Opaleye.</li>
