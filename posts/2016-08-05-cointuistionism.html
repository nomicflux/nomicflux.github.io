<p>Look at the following image:</p>

</div>
<p>We’ve got some red things in the middle, and some non-red things around them. But what happens in the middle?</p>
<p>Classical logic says: there is no middle. There’s no gap between red and non-red (<em>the law of the excluded middle</em>) and there’s no overlap (<em>the principle of non-contradiction</em>).</p>
<p>Another alternative is intuitionistic (or constructivist) logic, which states: There’s what’s provably red, and what’s provably not-red, and then some undecidable middle ground. In other words, the law of the excluded middle fails. But the principle of non-contradiction is, if anything, even more unimpeachable than in classical logic.</p>
<p>But when it comes to mathematics, we often get a dual notion, where everything is run backwards. Usually we use the prefix co- to denote such dualities, and this case is no different: there is also a co-intuistionistic logic, in which the law of the excluded middle holds, but the principle of non-contradiction fails. We get red, not-red, and a boundary region of red-and-not-red.</p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to set out what that means, and why it might be interesting to study.[1]</p>
<h3 id="classical-logic">Classical Logic</h3>
<p>First off, what would classical logic say about the boundary between red and non-red? What’s in the middle?</p>
<p>Classical logic would say that that circle I drew above is a fiction. It doesn’t exist. We just have the dots:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/classical.png" alt="Classical Image" />
<p class="caption">Classical Image</p>
</div>
<p>There’s just red and non-red dots. Sets of things are merely what they contain. So there is no boundary, really. But surely we can get closer and closer and closer to being red, until it’s ambiguous as to whether we are red or not, right?</p>
<p>In classical logic, that would just mean that “red” is not a precise enough term. We commit the fallacy of equivocation: we are trying to use “red” in multiple senses, from a deep scarlet to rust to verging on burgundy and blood orange. If we want to use logic, we need a precise term: an exact range of wavelengths, perhaps, or a set of HTML codes, even if it is just #FF0000. (And remember, there is absolutely nothing more to that set of HTML codes than just the HTML code(s) themselves; it is an exact list).</p>
<p>When we do have precise terms, and we know that they apply to something, this is reasonable. But is that always the case?</p>
<p>Logic is supposed to be a measuring stick for thinking. Classical logic focuses on the “measuring stick” part, but one could say that we need a logic for the “thinking” part as well, in the mess that is human thought. We don’t start with precision, we start in a mess. It may not even be possible for words to be made precise enough for classical logic, and some views of the nature of reality would deny that there is anything to be picked out with such precision (either because it’s all ultimately One, or all in flux and changing, or there is no way of getting outside of our conventional ways of thinking and speaking). So whether we want other logics for particular uses, in those cases when we don’t already have everything at hand which we need, or whether we think that there is no actual use for classical logic, the following alternatives offer us a larger picture.[3]</p>
<h3 id="intuistionistic-logic">Intuistionistic Logic</h3>
<p>Intuitionistic logic is a logic of gaps, and a logic of what can be verifiably proven either true or false vs. what can’t be decided. Returning to the picture from earlier, we have the following:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/intuitionistic.png" alt="Intuitionistic Image" />
<p class="caption">Intuitionistic Image</p>
</div>
<p>Here we have dots which are very clearly red. Then we also have dots which are very clearly non-red. But then we also leave open a gap in the middle.[4] There is the “undecidable” region as well.</p>
<p>In another setting: think of a unicorn. What colour is it? Does it have stripes? How long exactly is its horn? What is its genome, and how similar is it genetically to a liger? At some point, you probably don’t have an answer. Moreover, there’s no way to come up with an answer, because unicorns don’t exist (retroactive spoiler alert) so they can’t be studied, and at any rate the one in your head most certainly does not exist.[5]</p>
<p>Mathematics potentially has similar issues. We can prove that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">different sizes of infinities</a>; but is there an infinity between every such pairs of infinities? This is a simplified form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">Continuum Hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p>Again with infinities: if we have an infinite number of sets, can we arbitrarily pick one element from each set? This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom of Choice</a>, with its equivalent cousins the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_principle">Well-Ordering Principle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorn%27s_lemma">Zorn’s Lemma</a>.[6]</p>
<p>The common thread to all of this is that we can’t prove or disprove any of these statements from our normal foundations. We can accept the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis, or we can choose to reject them, without being inconsistent with the rest of mathematics. Similarly, we can say that unicorns are really mutant ligers with minimal genetic differences, or that they are the genetic oppsites (and sworn enemies) to them. There is nothing in our experience which can prove this one way or another.</p>
<p>So that does it for gaps and the undecidable. But wait, there’s more!</p>
<h3 id="cointuitionistic-logic">Cointuitionistic Logic</h3>
<p>Much less studied than intuitionistic logic is couintuitionistic logic. One way of thinking about the difference is this: Intuitionist logic starts by putting forth some basic things that are true, and then only allowing what we can prove or disprove from them. It is a minimalistic logic, trying to guard the necessity of inferences.</p>
<p>Cointuitionistic logic is the mirror image: We start by assuming that everything could potentially be true, except for some basic things which we can subtract out. “True” then means we can’t <strong>prove</strong> we can subtract something out from our view of the world, and “False” means we can’t prove that we can subtract out its negation. In terms of our picture:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/couintuitionistic.png" alt="Cointuitionistic Image" />
<p class="caption">Cointuitionistic Image</p>
</div>
<p>Red and non-red overlap. Cointuitionistic logic then is the logic of boundaries, of overlap, of regions of contradiction which don’t infect the entire space. It is a maximalist logic, trying to keep hold of everything which might possibly hold.</p>
<p>Back to our discussion of fiction: can dragons fly? Yes <em>and</em> no. There are possibilities for flying dragons and non-flying dragons; not merely in the sense that there could be different species of dragons, but also in that dragons don’t exist (retroactive double spoiler alert) so they have conflicting properties.</p>
<p>One reason for studying this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion">Principle of Explosion</a>. In both classical and intuitionistic logic, if you can ever show that there is a real contradiction, then you can prove anything. But like I said above, logic is a measuring stick for <em>thinking</em>, and oftentimes our thinking comes to contradiction. Maybe we think that there is strong evidence for A, and also strong evidence for B, but A leads to consequences which contradict the consequences of B (I’m leaving this general, to avoid picking sides on any troublesome issues, but feel free to substitute any moral and/or political dilemmas which you feel torn between). Cointuitionistic logic gives a space for those contradictions to exist, with both sides being held in discussion at once, while leaving open the possibility of debate and inference about clearer issues.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This has just been a short introduction to these different logics. I plan to talk about them more in the future. But to wrap up, here’s a chart of their differences:</p>
<h2 id="classical-intuitionistic-cointuitionistic">| Classical | Intuitionistic | Cointuitionistic</h2>
<p>Nature | Unambiguous and Precise | Minimalistic | Maximalistic In-betweens | Don’t Exist | Undecidable Gaps | Overlapping Boundaries Truth | Just What Is | Provable Inference | Lack of proof of subtraction Scope | Simple Existence | Necessities | Possibilities Unicorns v. Ligers | Bertrand Russell | Unicorns | Ligers</p>

<p>[1]: N.b.: For the logicians and pedants amongst you, this is an exploratory post, a place for me to put down my thoughts, and an expository post where I try to set down the basic intuitions (pun half-intended) for the different logics. I do plan on making this more precise in future posts. [2]: Technically, these different logics are systems of rules. I’m applying interpretations to them, to show what they could mean and how they might be used, but the algebraic patterns and rules of inference are what are basic. [3]: Even if one is perfectly satisfied with classical logic, intuitionistic and cointuistionistic logics form perfectly valid, rigorous, and precise patterns in their own right - see Heyting and Co-Heyting (or Brouwerian) algebra for more details. [4]: An astute reader might notice that this doesn’t solve the problem. Where do we draw the line for the “undecidable” region? If you thought this, have a cookie. If you didn’t, also have a cookie, because cookies are delicious. Think of red / non-red as an analogy, a ladder to be disposed of once you have climbed it. [5]: Well, depending on your views on the existence of fictional entities. [6]: A mathematical joke goes: The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the Well-Ordering Principle is obviously false, and about Zorn’s Lemma, who can say? The joke is that the three are all equivalent, in that proving any one lets you prove the other two. The different intuitions we have about the differing ways of interpreting the three statements is part of the reason why some mathematicians hold that they are constructions, rather than objective facts about the world.</p>
